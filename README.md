# City Explorer Würzburg

Bachelor Thesis, Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg

"City Explorer" is an interactive city guide that includes the context. In terms of learning theory, constructivism and its implications for a pervasive app are taken into account. By means of the development of the pervasive mobile learning game "City Explorer", scientific theories and current knowledge about learning as well as mobile and pervasive applications are implemented.
