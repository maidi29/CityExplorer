"City Explorer" is an interactive city guide that includes the context. In terms of learning theory, constructivism and its implications for a pervasive app are taken into account. By means of the development of the pervasive mobile learning game "City Explorer", scientific theories and current knowledge about learning as well as mobile and pervasive applications are implemented.

The game lets the user playfully explore the sights of the city of W체rzburg and imparts historical knowledge that can be internalized via creative tasks and quiz questions involving the surroundings.
Some of the city's sights are marked on the Google Maps map. If the user is within a radius of 200 meters of these markers, he can open the marker and read through information and images about the sight. At each marker there is a digital pinboard in the app where you can see and like photos, painted pictures or texts of other users.
For each sight, there are 2 tasks that the user can complete:
1. a creative task where you can put a text, a painted picture or a photo on the pinboard (these can be viewed later by other users).
2. a quiz with several single choice questions about the sight, some of which can be answered with information located at the sights. So you have to explore the surroundings while answering.

When one creates a creative pinboard entry and answers all the questions correctly, the place is considered completed.
This way you can earn badges and milestones.
