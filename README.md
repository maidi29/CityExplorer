# CityExplorer

Bachelor Thesis, Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg

By means of the development of the pervasive mobile learning game "City Explorer", scientific theories and current knowledge about learning as well as mobile and pervasive applications are implemented. 
The app is an interactive city guide that includes the context. In terms of learning theory, constructivism and its implications for a pervasive app are taken into account.
